Weekly Recipe & Shopping List Application - Design Document
Project Overview
A mobile-first, client-side web application hosted on GitHub Pages that helps a family of three (2 adults + 1 toddler) manage weekly dinner planning, recipes, kitchen inventory, and budgeted shopping lists. Data syncs across devices via Google Sheets.

Core Constraints

Zero infrastructure: Google Sheets as database
Free hosting: GitHub Pages static site
No backend: Google Sheets API called directly from browser
Cross-device sync: Same Google Sheet accessible from any device
Print-friendly: Shopping lists optimized for printing


Data Architecture: Google Sheets
Single Google Spreadsheet with the following tabs:

List:

Grouped by category (produce, protein, dairy, etc.)
Each item row: Checkbox | Item name | Quantity + unit | Est. price
Checked items strike through, move to bottom of category
Manual add: floating action button → item, quantity, unit, category, price

After Shopping:

"Log Actual Prices" button → editable price fields → saves to PriceHistory

Print View (CSS @media print):

No navigation, no buttons
Clean category headers
Large checkboxes (empty squares)
Item | Qty | Est. Price columns
Total at bottom
Single page optimized

6. Budget Summary
Purpose: Simple spending visibility
Elements:

This week: Estimated $XX
Last week: Actual $XX (from PriceHistory)
Simple bar or comparison
Link to full price history (optional, could be table)


Serving Size Logic
Fixed multiplier: 2.5x

All recipes store base servings
When generating shopping list:

needed_quantity = (ingredient_quantity / recipe_servings) * 2.5


Quantities rounded to practical amounts (e.g., 1.25 lb → 1.25, not 1.247)


Shopping List Generation Logic
1. Get all recipes in current week's MealPlan
2. For each recipe:
   a. Fetch ingredients
   b. Scale quantities by (2.5 / recipe.servings)
3. Aggregate ingredients by normalized item name
   - Sum quantities (must have same unit)
   - Keep category from first occurrence
4. Fetch Inventory
5. For each aggregated ingredient:
   a. If inventory.status == "have" → exclude
   b. If inventory.status == "low" → include (family wants to restock)
   c. If not in inventory → include
6. Look up typical_price from Inventory for estimates
7. Write to ShoppingList tab (clear previous week first)

Routing
Simple hash-based routing:

#/ → Home
#/recipes → Recipe list
#/recipes/new → Add recipe
#/recipes/:id → Recipe detail
#/recipes/:id/edit → Edit recipe
#/planner → Meal planner
#/inventory → Kitchen inventory
#/shopping → Shopping list
#/budget → Budget summary

Mobile-First Responsive Breakpoints

Mobile (default): < 640px — single column, bottom nav
Tablet: 640px+ — wider cards, side margins
Desktop: 1024px+ — sidebar nav, multi-column layouts
